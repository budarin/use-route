# Discuss Before Editing

When the user asks for something (fix, add, change) — **propose, discuss and agree with me on the solution**; only after agreement, write code.

## Order of Actions

1. **Propose a solution** — briefly describe what you plan to do (which files, which approach).
2. **Discuss** — answer questions, clarify details if needed.
3. **Agree with me** — do not change code until the user gives explicit consent (“да”, “ок”, “делай” и т.п.).
4. **Only after agreement** — apply changes in the repository.

## What Not to Do

- Do not start editing files right after the request without proposing and agreeing on a plan.
- Do not add “on your own” edits, comments or refactoring without being asked and without approval.

## Exceptions

If the user explicitly says "сделай", "исправь", "напиши" and has already described the task so that the plan is unambiguous — you may treat that as approval after briefly stating the plan in your reply. If in any doubt — clarify or propose an option and wait for a response.
